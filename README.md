## üéà Description<a name = "description"></a>

This module allows you to receive and transmit packets on the ["VAN" bus] of your Peugeot or Citroen vehicle.

VAN bus is pretty similar to CAN bus. It was used in many cars (Peugeot, Citroen) made by PSA.

In the beginning of 2000's the PSA group (Peugeot and Citroen) used VAN bus as a communication protocol
between the various comfort-related equipment. Later, around 2005, they started to replace this protocol
in their newer cars with the CAN bus protocol, however some models had VAN bus inside them until 2009.
[This overview](https://github.com/morcibacsi/PSAVanCanBridge#compatibility) lists vehicles that are
supposedly fitted with a VAN (comfort) bus.

Only ESP8266 / ESP8285 is supported. ESP32 is NOT supported by this library; for boards with those MCUs there is this
excellent library: [ESP32 RMT peripheral Vehicle Area Network (VAN bus) reader].

## üîå Schematics<a name = "schematics"></a>

You can usually find the VAN bus on pins 2 and 3 of ISO block "A" of your head unit (car radio). See 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectors_for_car_audio and https://github.com/morcibacsi/esp32_rmt_van_rx#schematics .

There are various possibilities to hook up a ESP8266 based board to your vehicle's VAN bus:

1. Use a [MCP2551] transceiver, connected with its CANH and CANL pins to the vehicle's VAN bus.
   As the MCP2551 has 5V logic, a 5V ‚Üî 3.3V [level converter] is needed to connect the CRX / RXD / R pin of the
   transceiver, via the level converter, to a GPIO pin of your ESP8266 board. For transmitting packets, also connect
   the CTX / TXD / D pins of the transceiver, via the level converter, to a GPIO pin of your ESP8266 board.

   A board with the MCP2551 transceiver can be ordered e.g.
   [here](https://webshop.domoticx.nl/can-bus-transceiver-module-5v-mcp2551) or
   [here](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004475976642.html).

![schema](extras/Schematics/Schematic%20using%20MCP2551_bb.png)

> üëâ Notes:
>  * CANH of the transceiver is connected to VAN BAR (DATA B), CANL to VAN (DATA). This may seem illogical
     but in practice it turns out this works best.
>  * The clamping circuit (D1, D2, R1) seems to (somehow) help in reducing the amount of bit errors
     (packet CRC errors).

2. Use a [SN65HVD230] transceiver, connected with its CANH and CANL pins to the vehicle's VAN bus.
   The SN65HVD230 transceiver already has 3.3V logic, so it is possible to directly connect the CRX / RXD / R pin of
   the transceiver to a GPIO pin of your ESP8266 board. For transmitting packets, also connect the CTX / TXD / D pins
   of the transceiver to a GPIO pin of your ESP8266 board.

   A board with the SN65HVD230 transceiver can be ordered e.g.
   [here](https://webshop.domoticx.nl/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3935).

3. The simplest schematic is not to use a transceiver at all, but connect the VAN DATA line to GrouND using
   two 4.7 kOhm resistors. Connect the GPIO pin of your ESP8266 board to the 1:2 [voltage divider] that is thus
   formed by the two resistors. This is only for receiving packets, not for transmitting. Results may vary.

> üëâ Note: I used this schematic during many long debugging hours, but I cannot guarantee that it won't ultimately
     cause your car to explode! (or anything less catastrofic)

## üöÄ Usage<a name = "usage"></a>

### General<a name = "general"></a>

Add the following line to your ```.ino``` sketch:
```
#include <VanBus.h>
```

For receiving and transmitting packets:

1. Add the following lines to your initialisation block ```void setup()```:
```
int TX_PIN = D3; // GPIO pin connected to VAN bus transceiver input
int RX_PIN = D2; // GPIO pin connected to VAN bus transceiver output
TVanBus::Setup(RX_PIN, TX_PIN);
```

2. Add e.g. the following lines to your main loop ```void loop()```:
```
TVanPacketRxDesc pkt;
if (VanBus.Receive(pkt)) pkt.DumpRaw(Serial);

uint8_t rmtTemperatureBytes[] = {0x0F, 0x07, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x70};
VanBus.SyncSendPacket(0x8A4, 0x08, rmtTemperatureBytes, sizeof(rmtTemperatureBytes));
```

If you only want to receive packets, you may save a few hundred precious bytes by using directly the ```VanBusRx```
object:

1. Add the following lines to your initialisation block ```void setup()```:
```
int RX_PIN = D2; // GPIO pin connected to VAN bus transceiver output
VanBusRx.Setup(RX_PIN);
```

2. Add the following lines to your main loop ```void loop()```:
```
TVanPacketRxDesc pkt;
if (VanBusRx.Receive(pkt)) pkt.DumpRaw(Serial);
```

### ```VanBus``` object

Returns the number of VAN packets, offered for transmitting, since power-on. Counter may roll over.

### VAN packets

On a VAN bus, the electrical signals are the same as CAN. However, CAN and VAN use different data encodings on the
line which makes it impossible to use CAN interfaces on a VAN bus.

#### 1. ```uint16_t Iden()``` <a name = "Iden"></a>

Returns the IDEN field of the VAN packet.

An overview of known IDEN values can be found e.g. at:

- http://pinterpeti.hu/psavanbus/PSA-VAN.html
- http://graham.auld.me.uk/projects/vanbus/protocol.html

#### 2. ```uint8_t CommandFlags()``` <a name = "CommandFlags"></a>

Returns the 4-bit "command" FLAGS field of the VAN packet. Each VAN packet has 4 "command" flags:
- EXT (bit 3, MSB) : always 1
- RAK (bit 2): 1 = Requesting AcKnowledge
- R/W (bit 1): 1 = Read operation, 0 = Write operation
- RTR (bit 0, LSB): 1 = Remote Transmit Request

A thorough explanation is found (in French) on page 6 and 7 of
http://www.educauto.org/files/file_fields/2013/11/18/mux3.pdf#page=6 .

#### 3. ```const uint8_t* Data()``` <a name = "Data"></a>

Returns the data field (bytes) of the VAN packet.

#### 4. ```int DataLen()``` <a name = "DataLen"></a>

Returns the number of data bytes in the VAN packet. There can be at most 28 data bytes in a VAN packet.

#### 5. ```unsigned long Millis()``` <a name = "Millis"></a>

Packet time stamp in milliseconds.

#### 6. ```uint16_t Crc()``` <a name = "Crc"></a>

Returns the 15-bit CRC value of the VAN packet.

#### 7. ```bool CheckCrc()``` <a name = "CheckCrc"></a>

Checks the CRC value of the VAN packet.

#### 8. ```bool CheckCrcAndRepair()``` <a name = "CheckCrcAndRepair"></a>

Checks the CRC value of the VAN packet. If not, tries to repair it by flipping each bit. Returns ```true``` if the
packet is OK (either before or after the repair).

#### 9. ```void DumpRaw(Stream& s, char last = '\n')``` <a name = "DumpRaw"></a>

Dumps the raw packet bytes to a stream. Optionally specify the last character; default is '\n' (newline).

Example of invocation:

    pkt.DumpRaw(Serial);

Example of output:

    Raw: #0002 ( 2/15) 11(16) 0E 4D4 RA0 82-0C-01-00-11-00-3F-3F-3F-3F-82:7B-A4 ACK OK 7BA4 CRC_OK

Example of dumping into a char array:

    const char* PacketRawToStr(TVanPacketRxDesc& pkt)
    {
        static char dumpBuffer[MAX_DUMP_RAW_SIZE];
        
        GString str(dumpBuffer);
        PrintAdapter streamer(str);
        pkt.DumpRaw(streamer, '\0');
        
        return dumpBuffer;
    }

Note: for this, you will need to install the [PrintEx](https://github.com/Chris--A/PrintEx) library. I tested with
version 1.2.0 .

#### 10. ```const char* CommandFlagsStr()``` <a name = "CommandFlagsStr"></a>

Returns the "command" FLAGS field of the VAN packet as a string

Note: uses a statically allocated buffer, so don't call this method twice within the same printf invocation.

#### 11. ```const char* AckStr()``` <a name = "AckStr"></a>

Returns the ACK field of the VAN packet as a string, either "ACK" or "NO_ACK".

#### 12. ```const char* ResultStr()``` <a name = "ResultStr"></a>

Returns the RESULT field of the VAN packet as a string, either "OK" or a string starting with "ERROR_".

#### 13. ```const TIfsDebugPacket& getIfsDebugPacket()``` <a name = "getIfsDebugPacket"></a>

Retrieves a debug structure that can be used to analyse inter-frame space events.

Only available when ```#define VAN_RX_ISR_DEBUGGING``` is uncommented (see
[```VanBusRx.h```](https://github.com/0xCAFEDECAF/VanBus/blob/756b05097e57c183f87b7879e431308daef5ce5f/VanBusRx.h#L32)).

#### 14. ```const TIsrDebugPacket& getIsrDebugPacket()``` <a name = "getIsrDebugPacket"></a>

Retrieves a debug structure that can be used to analyse (observed) bit timings.

Only available when ```#define VAN_RX_IFS_DEBUGGING``` is uncommented (see
[```VanBusRx.h```](https://github.com/0xCAFEDECAF/VanBus/blob/756b05097e57c183f87b7879e431308daef5ce5f/VanBusRx.h#L33)).

## üë∑ Work to be Done<a name = "todo"></a>

### Future

Currently the library supports only 125 kbit/s VAN bus. Need to add support for different rate, like 62.5 kbit/s,
which can be passed as an optional parameter to ```VanBusRx.Setup(...)```.
