## üéà Description <a name = "description"></a>

This module allows you to receive packets on the "VAN" bus of your Peugeot or Citroen vehicle.

VAN bus is pretty similar to CAN bus. It was used in many cars (Peugeot, Citroen) made by PSA.

In the beginning of 2000's the PSA group (Peugeot and Citroen) used VAN bus as a communication protocol
between the various comfort-related equipment. Later, around 2005, they started to replace this protocol
in their newer cars with the CAN bus protocol, however some models had VAN bus inside them until 2009.

Only ESP8266 / ESP8285 is supported. ESP32 is NOT supported by this library; for boards with those MCUs there is this
excellent library: [ESP32 RMT peripheral Vehicle Area Network (VAN bus) reader].

## üîå Schematics <a name = "schematics"></a>

You can usually find the VAN bus on pins 2 and 3 of ISO block "A" of your head unit (car radio). See 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectors_for_car_audio and https://github.com/morcibacsi/esp32_rmt_van_rx#schematics .

There are various possibilities to hook up a ESP8266 based board to your vehicle's VAN bus:

1. Use a [MCP2551] transceiver, connected with its CANH and CANL pins to the vehicle's VAN bus.
   As the MCP2551 has 5V logic, a 5V ‚ÜîÔ∏è 3.3V [level converter] is needed to connect the CRX / RXD / R pin of the
   transceiver to a GPIO pin of your ESP8266 board.

2. Use a [SN65HVD230] transceiver, connected with its CANH and CANL pins to the vehicle's VAN bus.
   The SN65HVD230 transceiver already has 3.3V logic, so it is possible to directly connect the CRX / RXD / R pin of
   the transceiver to a GPIO pin of your ESP8266 board.
   ![schema](extras/schematics/Schematic%20using%20SN65HVD230_bb.png)
   
3. The simplest schematic is not to use a transceiver at all, but connect the VAN DATA line to GrouND using
   two 4.7 kOhm resistors. Connect the GPIO pin of your ESP8266 board to the 1:2 [voltage divider] that is thus
   formed by the two resistors. Results may vary.

   üëâ Note: I used this schematic during many long debugging hours, but I cannot guarantee that it won't ultimately
      cause your car to explode! (or anything less catastrofic)

## üöÄ Usage<a name = "usage"></a>

### General <a name = "general"></a>

Add the following line to your ```.ino``` sketch:
```
#include <VanBus.h>
```

Add the following lines to your initialisation block ```void setup()```:
```
int RECV_PIN = D2; // Set to GPIO pin connected to VAN bus transceiver output
VanBus.Setup(RECV_PIN);
```

Add the following line to your main loop ```void loop()```:
```
TVanPacketRxDesc pkt;
if (VanBus.Receive(pkt)) pkt.DumpRaw(Serial);
```

### ```VanBus``` object

The following methods are available for the ```VanBus``` object:<a name = "functions"></a>

1. [```void Setup(uint8_t rxPin)```](#Setup)
2. [```bool Available()```](#Available)
3. [```bool Receive(TVanPacketRxDesc& pkt, bool* isQueueOverrun = NULL)```](#Receive)
4. [```uint32_t GetCount()```](#GetCount)
5. [```void DumpStats(Stream& s)```](#DumpStats)

---

### 1. ```void Setup(uint8_t rxPin)``` <a name = "Setup"></a>

Start the receiver listening on GPIO pin ```rxPin```.

### 2. ```bool Available()``` <a name = "Available"></a>

Returns ```true``` if a VAN packet is available in the receive queue.

### 3. ```bool Receive(TVanPacketRxDesc& pkt, bool* isQueueOverrun = NULL)``` <a name = "Receive"></a>

Copy a VAN packet out of the receive queue, if available. Otherwise, returns ```false```.
Optionally, passes queue overrun condition into ```isQueueOverrun```.

### 4. ```uint32_t GetCount()``` <a name = "GetCount"></a>

Returns the number of received VAN packets since power-on. Counter may roll over.

### 5. ```void DumpStats(Stream& s)``` <a name = "DumpStats"></a>

Dumps a few packet statistics on the passed stream.

### VAN packets

On a VAN bus, the electrical signals are the same as CAN. However, CAN and VAN use different data encodings on the
line which makes it impossible to use CAN interfaces on a VAN bus.

---

### 1. ```uint16_t Iden()``` <a name = "Iden"></a>

Returns the IDEN field of the VAN packet.

An overview of known IDEN values can be found e.g. at:

- http://pinterpeti.hu/psavanbus/PSA-VAN.html
- http://graham.auld.me.uk/projects/vanbus/protocol.html

### 2. ```uint16_t Flags()``` <a name = "Flags"></a>

Returns the "command" FLAGS field of the VAN packet. Each VAN packet has 4 "command" flags:
- EXT : always 1
- RAK : 1 = Requesting AcKnowledge
- R/W : 1 = Read operation, 0 = Write operation
- RTR : 1 = Remote Transmit Request

A thorough explanation is found (in French) on page 6 and 7 of
http://www.educauto.org/files/file_fields/2013/11/18/mux3.pdf#page=6 .

### 3. ```const uint8_t* Data()``` <a name = "Data"></a>

Returns the data field (bytes) of the VAN packet.

### 4. ```int DataLen()``` <a name = "DataLen"></a>

Returns the number of data bytes in the VAN packet. There can be at most 28 data bytes in a VAN packet.

### 5. ```uint16_t Crc()``` <a name = "Crc"></a>

Returns the 15-bit CRC value of the VAN packet.

### 6. ```bool CheckCrc()``` <a name = "CheckCrc"></a>

Checks the CRC value of the VAN packet.

### 7. ```bool CheckCrcAndRepair()``` <a name = "CheckCrcAndRepair"></a>

Checks the CRC value of the VAN packet. If not, tries to repair it by flipping each bit. Returns ```true``` if the
packet is OK (either before or after the repair).

### 8. ```void DumpRaw(Stream& s, char last = '\n')``` <a name = "DumpRaw"></a>

Dumps the raw packet bytes to a stream. Optionally specify the last character; default is '\n' (newline).

Example of invocation:

    pkt.DumpRaw(Serial);

Example of output:

    Raw: #0002 ( 2/15) 16 0E 4D4 RA0 82-0C-01-00-11-00-3F-3F-3F-3F-82-7B-A4 ACK OK 7BA4 CRC_OK

Example of dumping into a char array:

    const char* PacketRawToStr(TVanPacketRxDesc& pkt)
    {
        static char dumpBuffer[MAX_DUMP_RAW_SIZE];
        
        GString str(dumpBuffer);
        PrintAdapter streamer(str);
        pkt.DumpRaw(streamer, '\0');
        
        return dumpBuffer;
    }

Note: for this, you will need to install the [PrintEx](https://github.com/Chris--A/PrintEx) library. I tested with
version 1.2.0 .

### 9. ```const TIsrDebugPacket& getIsrDebugPacket()``` <a name = "getIsrDebugPacket"></a>

Retrieves a debug structure that can be used to analyse (observed) bit timings.

### 10. ```const char* FlagsStr()``` <a name = "FlagsStr"></a>

Returns the "command" FLAGS field of the VAN packet as a string

Note: uses a statically allocated buffer, so don't call this method twice within the same printf invocation.

### 11. ```const char* AckStr()``` <a name = "AckStr"></a>

Returns the ACK field of the VAN packet as a string, either "ACK" or "NO_ACK".

### 12. ```const char* ResultStr()``` <a name = "ResultStr"></a>

Returns the RESULT field of the VAN packet as a string, either "OK" or a string starting with "ERROR_".

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations, Caveats

The library times the incoming bits using an interrupt service routine (ISR) that triggers on pin "change" events (see the internal function ```PinChangeIsr``` in [VanBus.cpp](https://github.com/0xCAFEDECAF/VanBus/blob/master/VanBus.cpp#L319)). It seems that the invocation of the ISR is often quite late (or maybe the bits are wobbly on the line already).

I had to do a bit of tweaking to be able to reconstruct the real bits from the number of CPU cycles that have elapsed between the ISR invocations. Still, not all packets are received error-free. Even after trying to "repair" a packet (see function [```bool CheckCrcAndRepair()```](#CheckCrcAndRepair)), the long-term average packet loss is around 0.05% (1 in 2000), which is ok(-ish). I am investigating how to improve on this.

## üë∑ Work to be done

### Near future

Currently the library supports only 125 kbit/s VAN bus. Need to add support for different rate, like 62.5 kbit/s, which can be
passed as an optional parameter to ```VanBus.Setup(...)```.

### Looking forward

Currently I am writing a VAN packet parser that will be able to send WebSocket messages to a browser, for real-time
updates on a "virtual dashboard" web page that is served by the ESP8266 based board. I am looking for volunteers who
can draw a nice skin for this "virtual dashboard" üòÅ. Inspiration? Have a look e.g. at
https://realdash.net/gallery.php.
